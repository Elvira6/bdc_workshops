Instructions

Please download Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/) for Linux, Mac, and Windows. You’ll be using it to run the workshops. There are installation instructions and the first thing you should do is open the R - Jupyter Essentials in 5 Minutes.ipynb notebook for R and the Python - Jupyter Essentials in 5 Minutes.ipynb for Python.

We will hold webinars every week to cover the materials introduced the week prior. Emails with a google hangouts link will be sent out for all participants to join. It will be recorded so those who can’t make the webinar can view it at another time. This is important as it allows everyone in the competition to ask questions towards the workshop authors!

Week 1: Intro to Stats
Week 2: Workshop 1: Data manipulation
Week 3: Workshop 2: Data Visualization
Week 4: Workshop 3: Tableau Introduction
Week 5: Workshop 4: Basic Machine learning

Please please please work on your projects WHILE working on the Workshops. This will increase your chances of success and the workshops were designed to guide your timeline.
