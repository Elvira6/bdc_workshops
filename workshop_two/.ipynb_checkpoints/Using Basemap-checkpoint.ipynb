    "Like Folium, Basemap is a library used to plot geopoints on a map. It is built on top of Matplotlib and is more popular that Folium. However, the maps generated from Basemap aren't as detailed and may look bland. It is howver good for showcasing plots spread over a large landmasses (like a province or country). Before pursuing this library, I'll show you some photos of what Basemap looks like to guide your decision. Personally I will never touch Basemap again (after finding Folio) but hey, for those who like more documentation this is the library for you."
