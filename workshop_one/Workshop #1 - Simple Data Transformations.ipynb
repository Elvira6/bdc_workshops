    "3. Gathering insights (Feature Engineering)\n",
    "4. Generate the models\n",

    "###### Glancing at the data\n",

    "\n",
    "###### Normalization and cleaning\n",
    "Some things I usually look at when I'm glancing at data are the means of the columns, the unique values of categorical variables, and counts. This should spark some questions if you see an abnormally high number in a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Gathering insights\n",
    "Once we understand our data, we'll have to start cleaning our data for modeling.

An example of feature engineering is extracting the surnames out of someone's name to relate families on a row. Another example would be to count the number of fruits for each meal presented. The goal of feature engineering is to provide more variables for our algorithms to play with. My manually identifying these patterns, the computer doesn't have to expend additional effort to discover these patterns algorithmically.\n",

    "From experience, steps 1-3 should take up 90% of your time. It also just so happens that the first three steps occur organically with the inception of your questions.

Then you may have more questions so you'll repeat the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Generating the models\n",
    "Once our dataset has been prepared, we can finally have some fun and do some machine learning to make predictions! Depending on the type of dataset, you may want to implement a regression algorithm to redict a numeric value (like predicting the speed of a car given these variables) or sort variables into different categories (like passing or failing a test)"
